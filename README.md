Basic shopping cart implementation made using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, React Router, and Firebase's Realtime Database.

The store uses the FakeStore API to populate the storefront. This was an exercise of fetching data from an API and processing it and displaying it to the client. 

The typescript is probably very naive, but I found that using Typescript help to minimize any bugs while in development. There is probably a fair amount of cleanup that can be done. In addition, using Tailwind is a nice developer experience, but may be overkill for something simple such as this. Nevertheless, having mostly standardized classes help reduce the requirement to name things and keep things fairly simple.

React Router is used for client side routing, just for fun. 

The backend is just the Realtime Database using Firebase. The cart will be saved in the database as long as the user signs in using Google Auth. I first tried to use it strictly from the documents but found myself fumbling a little. Instead, I found the firebase hooks NPM bundle and that made things a little easier. To help reinforce my learning, I went through the documentation for the NPM bundle and understood where my inexperience led me to my mistakes.

Potential improvements;
1) Some sort of data persistence (local storage perhaps?) [DONE, implemented with Firebase ( as long as user is logged in, else the cart does not save).
2) Some sort of loading screen while waiting to fetch from FakeStore.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
